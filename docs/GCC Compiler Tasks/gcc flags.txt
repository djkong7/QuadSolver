-Wall -pedantic -std=c11


-Wall
	This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.


-std=c11
	ISO C99. This standard is substantially completely supported, modulo bugs and floating-point issues (mainly but not entirely relating to optional C99 features from Annexes F and G). See http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html for more information. The names ‘c9x’ and ‘iso9899:199x’ are deprecated.

-pendantic

	"Parameter -Wpedantic is available in newer gcc with a slight different meaning of -pedantic."
